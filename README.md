# Flutter Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Create an application that fetches data from the Gutenberg Library API to display books from their library.

Gutenberg API: http://gutendex.com/

Upload your project to a repository on Github and share it with us.


## Specification

The app should consist of two screens

- An initial screen with a list/grid of books from Gutenberg Library's collection
  This screen should also include a search functionality as well   
- A screen with details of a certain book of the collection.
  This screen is opened when you tap an item in the initial screen. What to display (title, cover, author, etc.) is up to you
